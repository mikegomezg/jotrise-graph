- I love the outliner format
- if you think about it, eveything is basically an outline
- the outline is how we make sense of complexity
- every conversation has context and that context is a decision about how we structure the entities and we need to decide what goes where even though we know there are multiple entites
- it is like in economics when you need to do comparative pricing across 2 entitles when we know that the pricing is actually happening across all of them simultaneously
- so it goes with conversation and thinking
- so of course you can create a lot of bullets and structure them
- and you can do it on a journal page so that you have a record of what you thought when
- and you can copy that page and adjust it on another day
- if you tag things the same way, you can see how that thinking evolves
- Git also adds another dimension
- I would love to see deeper integration between Git and Logseq and taking that commit graph and combining it with the daily journal #[[Logseq improvements]]
- manipulating outlines is an important skill and it doesn't work as smoothly as I would like
- I end up using both the mouse and the keyboard
- but it is helpful to look at a list of bullets and see the commonalities and rearrange them if needed
- this idea of progressive refinement is important
- I encountered it in cooking class where the chef distinguished fine dinning as simply restraunts with higher quality tools of refinement
- and it is worth pointing that out in terms of ideas
- not everything needs to be heavily refined, and ideas are at different stages
- but for those that do, you can take them through this process of multiple days of reflection and then finally putting them on a dedicated page
- there is this idea of reification, of making an idea a thing that you can manipulate
- typically I don't create dedicated entities for specific ideas, but I do sometimes
- in this case, you want to have a naming convention so that you can clearly identify the idea
- this is a general issue with Logseq and other knowledge graph where each entity is identified by name
- Tana does things to mitigate it
- Roam may do this as well
