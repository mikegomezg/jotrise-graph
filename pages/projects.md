- intro
	- When you think about it, a task is just a special type of note
	- It potentially puts a demand on you to follow up with it
- It makes sense to include a record of your tasks with your notes
	- often when you are brainstorming or thinking about a problem, you think of things you need to do to solve it
	- brainstorming can result in a lot of tasks, many of which you won't do
	- I find it helpful to list these ideas someplace
	- writing down all the useful things you could potentially do, helps free my mind
	- I don't worry about forgetting about some important step
- Getting Things Done emphasizes figuring out your next action
	- once I have a list of ideas, I decide which one of those should go under the category of todos
	- some people use the todo functionality, but I prefer to just organize the todos and then copy the relevant ones to my task manager
	- the task manager lets me track everything across devices, including mundane tasks that aren't worth documenting in Logseq
	- This system is flexible because I can record the bulk of my notes in Logseq and change the next thing I'm doing on the fly in TickTick
- When I work on a project, I reference it in my daily notes
	- I may have a meeting about it
	- before the meeting, I can use that project tag to see all the related notes I may have about it
	- then I typically consolidate that info on the daily notes page beneath the project
	- only the permant stuff about a project will I move to the dedicated page
	- It could make sense to have an ongoing summary that I keep on the project page
- An important theme is whether to work in the journal or dedicated pages
	- for projects, sometimes I'll ideate in the journal page
	- but I prefer to have a dedicated page for each project and record my todos in an special project section
	- within that section I distinguish between "ideas" and todos
	- I also can keep archived tasks there
	- I tend to just delete tasks from the project page, but it would be better to actually just copy them to the journal page on the day that I complete them
- you can also embed blocks into other pages
	- this is useful if you want to have 1 page that tracks all your projects and then expand it to see exactly what the next action should be
