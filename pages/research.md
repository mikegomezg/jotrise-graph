- research is a part of project management for me but it has some special use cases
- I take notes in the daily journal
- usually if I'm watching a video or reading something, I'll have Logseq next to it and record notes as I go
- It is possible to connect Logseq to other systems and import highlights
- I usually use Obsdian for that and structure the import as block that I can open in Logseq
- working with large pages of highlights can be difficult
- I mainly do it to organize my knowledge
- I went through this with How To Take Smart Notes
- Here is an example
- I found it useful, but typically I don't go through all of this trouble
- I could see this being more useful for academics and people that need to keep close track of their sources
- See these influencers for more info about how they do research
- I do use this chrome extension to easily create markdown links
- Occasionlly I change the title of the link but it is also each enough to just create a parent block and collapse the link within int
- I do struggle with the markdown link format and office applications
