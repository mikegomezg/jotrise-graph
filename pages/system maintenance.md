- the system category is about meta-processing
- you are evaluating how good this note-taking system is
- how well are you thinking about thinking and how easy are you making things for yourself
- it is difficult to think in this mode all the time
- it can be exhausting and it can be a major distraction
- but it also can be extremely useful
- think about when you are slow at work and you have the freedom to step back and consider how well you are doing things
- often I will come up with experiments and things to investigate and I always benefit from going through that
- I find writing things down to be really useful
- but it is also helpful to have a thought structure to work from
- and that is what this system review is doing for you
- look at your process tags and see what types of notes you tend to take
- create a tag for them and you can find links across projects
- that is a main benefit
- you begin to standardize your process so that it is clear how you should take notes and you can focus on the what
- I like the [[project]] tag because it lets me mark up the sections of my pages that deal with what I should do
- I can also tag specific entities in the Contents page as having a [[project]] tag
- because it is so easy to create a task anywhere, you need to be careful about which pages should have projects in them
- sub topics typically should not
- the topics are important because you want to make distinctions
- but you want to avoid tagging at too low a level because you can easily miss things
- deciding when to create an entity and when to tag a note with that specific tag is an art and will come with experience
- I'll look out for some examples that illustrate this
