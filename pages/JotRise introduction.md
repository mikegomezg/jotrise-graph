	- what is this site and why is it needed
		- Logseq is a free notetaking tool released in 2020
		- I started using Logseq in 2021 and found it really useful
		- I want to show you how to use Logseq to refine and share your ideas
		- this site is for showcasing what I've learned
		- I'm interested in this type of software
		- my approach is to take what is simple and available for free and discovery what I would pay for
			- that is an important approach of discovering value
		- I'm still not even clear how you would categorize this software and tools for thought in general
		- I think networked outliners are powerful tools but there isn't enough practical material out there for new people to use them
		- they can be complex but there is opportunity to simplify things
		- I want to drive discussion about how we can move these tools forward
		- I want to make these tools more accessible so that more people use and benefit from them
	- why the focus on Logseq?
