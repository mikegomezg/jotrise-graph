	- there has recently been an explosion of new networked note-taking tools, known as tools for thought, but these tools can be difficult for new users to approach
	- it is easy to lose information in these tools
	- people need a framework for approaching these new note-taking tools
	- these tools hold a lot of promise, but we need to collectively show what we want out of them and how they can improve
- why the focus on Logseq?
	- Logseq is free to use
		- all you need is the time to learn it and an open mind
	- Logseq is open-source
		- we can understand how the software works
		- we can change the software to fit out needs
	- Logseq is file-based and local-first
		- you decide where you want to store the data
		- you decide what data you want to share
		- you can incorporate your workflow with Git and easily share your work with others
			- GitHub publish action
			- sharing best practices
	- Logseq is build on technologies that feed into paid programs
		- both Roam and Tana use a similar approach, but Logseq helps you get started and move to those tools if you see the need
